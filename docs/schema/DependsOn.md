# DependsOn

This section provides an overview on the system-level dependencies required to install and use this software.

NOTE: do not list dependencies at the source code level (e.g.: software libraries being used), and focus only on runtime and/or system-level dependencies that must be installed and maintained separately. For instance, a database is a good example of such dependencies.
